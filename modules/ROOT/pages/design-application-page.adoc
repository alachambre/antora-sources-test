= Design an application page

So far, with a process, data, forms, and connectors, we've built a fully functional software solution to manage claims.
But what if we want to have a dashboard showing all ongoing claims?
Such a dashboard is not a process.
You should not have to "start" it in order to view it.
A Bonita application is the answer.
And the first step to build an application is to create pages.

::: info Pages in Bonita are a lot like forms.
They are created with the UI Designer with the same sets of widgets.
The main difference is that they are not bound with a process definition (like instantiation forms and user tasks forms).
An application page can display business data values, charts and even let the user start a process or execute a task by displaying the appropriate form.
:::

For this example, we will build a basic page that displays all the claims submitted in a table.
To create a new page:

. Click on the *UI Designer* icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/design-application-page/ui-designer.png[UI Designer icon] in the Studio tool bar
. Ignore the information message pop up window
. Click on the *create* button
. Make sure that *Application page* is selected
. Type the name: _claimsList_
. Click on the *Create* button
+

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

On the new page, you can let the UI Designer automatically create variables to retrieve business data:

. At the top left corner of the UI Designer, click on the *data model* button image:images/getting-started-tutorial/design-application-page/data-model.png[Data model button]
. In the list of business objects, select the _Claim_ object and drag and drop it in the empty space of the page
. In the pop up window, change *Variable name* from _claim_ to _claims_
. In *Additionnal queries* section, select _find_
. Click on the *Save* button
+

// {.img-responsive .img-thumbnail}

Add and configure the table widget:

. From the widget palette on the left, drag and drop a *Table* widget to the whiteboard
. In the widget property on the right:
 ** Set the *headers* name: _Description, Answer, Satisfaction level_
 ** For *content*, click on the *fx* button
 ** Enter _claims_ for the value
 ** Set *Column keys* to: _description, answer, satisfactionLevel_
. Click on the UI Designer *Save* button
. Click on the *Preview* button to get a preview of your page
+

::: warning In order for preview to access the data, a user needs to be logged in to the Bonita Portal.
You can click on the *Portal* button in the Bonita Studio tool bar to make sure a user is logged in.

Now you have your first application page.
It's time to move to the xref:create-application.adoc[next chapter] and create the xref:create-application.adoc[application] that will include the page.
