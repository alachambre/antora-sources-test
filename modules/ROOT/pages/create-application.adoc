= Create an application
:experimental:

Creating the application is the final step of this Getting Started tutorial.

But before we actually create the application, we need to deploy our application page in the Bonita Portal:

. In the Bonita Studio menu click on menu:File[Deploy]
. Click on *Select all* button to make sure everything is deployed: test organization, business data model, process definition, application page
. Make sure that *Clean BDM database before deployment* is not checked as we want to keep our data for testing
. Click on *Deploy* button
. In the *Deploy status* pop up window, click on *Close* button

Now we are ready to actually create the application.
In the Bonita Community Edition, the easiest way to create an application is to use the Bonita Portal:

. Click on the Portal icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/create-application/portal-icon.png[Portal icon] in the Bonita Studio tool bar
. In the upper right corner of the window, click on the *User* drop down menu
. Select *Administrator*
. Click on the *Applications* tab
. Click on the *New* button
. Configure the application:
 ** Display name: _Claims_
 ** URL: _claims_
 ** Version: _1.0_
 ** Profile: _User_
 ** Description: _Claims management application_
. Click on the *Create* button
+

You now need to edit the application to add the previously created application page:

. Click on the *...* icon in the *Actions* column
. In the *Pages* section, click on the *Add* button
. In the drop down list, select _custompage_claimsList - claimsList_
. In *URL* type: _claims-list_
. Click on the *Add* button
. In the pages list, click on the *home icon* to set claims-list as the home page and delete the default home
. We've kept this application very simple, with only a single page, so we don't need to define a navigation menu
+

You can now click on the application URL, and you'll see the application page displayed in the default application layout.

Congratulations!
